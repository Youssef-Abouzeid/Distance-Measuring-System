# Distance-Measuring-System
This repository contains the implementation of a distance measurement system using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) and an ATmega32 microcontroller with a frequency of 8MHz. The project follows a layered architecture model, consisting of GPIO, ICU, LCD, and Ultrasonic drivers.
